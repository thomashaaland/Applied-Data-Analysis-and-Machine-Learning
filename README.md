# Fys-Stk4155
Applied Dataanalysis and Machine Learning.
Contains 3 projects. 
* Project 1 explore Linear regression and implements Ridge and Lasso regression. We create our own dataset using the Frankefunction and later apply the methods to terrain data from over Norway.
* Project 2 implement Logistic regression and a Feed Forward Neural Network. The network is faulty, but I haven't figured out how. It seem to act like a simple logistic regression. The dataset used for this project is the Hong Kong credit dataset.
* Project 3 use Support Vector Machine and Convolutional Neural Network to make diagnostics on X-ray images to detect pneumonia.
